the gyroscope is connected to the Arduino board using the SDA and SCL pins. The VCC and GND pins of the gyroscope are connected to the corresponding power and ground pins on the Arduino board. This simple circuit allows the Arduino board to communicate with the gyroscope and read the data from the sensor.
